# CMPE 223 Project 2 - Sorting Applications
As a homework assignment, we are given some integers and expected to write a program which finds the smallest pairwise absolute difference. In order to handle this problem, I wrote my own sorting classes to understand how to apply them.

## Part 1
In the first part of the homework, I just created the sorting classes by inspring from the examples we were given. The critical point of the first part is understanding how to change the system of sorting algorithms such as changing the order (descending or ascending) and the comparison way of attributes (by looking at their source or destination).

## Part 2
In the second part of the homework, I tested the program with the given inputs.

Example Input/Output:

    Input: 23, 1, 5, 102, 34, 99
    Output: 3 [99 102]

    Input: 23, 1, 4, 102, 34, 99
    Output: 3 [1 4]

    Input: 113, 23, 1, 109, 4, 102, 7, 105, 100, 107
    Output: 2 [100 102]

## Conclusion
At the end of the project, I tried my program with different sorting algorithms that I wrote myself, in order to see the run time difference.
